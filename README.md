# Purdue Grade Tracker

This project serves as a CLI-based grade tracker. While this app is tailored to my needs, it can be used by most students.

This is my first project using Git, GitHub, and my first Python project that is separate from my coursework.

Progress:

4/24/24 - Project Initialization, added Semester write-to-file functionality, implemented Course class

4/25/24 - Implemented basic Course write-to-file functionality
